# Frontend Projects – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This repository is a curated collection of frontend development projects built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. These projects range from beginner-friendly interfaces to more interactive and logic-driven applications, showcasing creativity, problem-solving, and UI/UX design skills.

## 🚀 Purpose

The aim of this repository is to:

- Strengthen core frontend development skills
- Practice DOM manipulation and JavaScript fundamentals
- Build responsive and interactive user interfaces
- Explore web APIs, visual logic, animations, and real-time features
- Experiment with small-scale projects involving data processing, canvas rendering, and browser APIs

These projects are ideal for learning, practice, and demonstrating frontend development capabilities in real-world scenarios.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structured, semantic markup  
- **CSS3** – Layouts with Flexbox & Grid, transitions, animations, responsive design  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Logic, interactivity, events, APIs, and browser integration  
- **Browser APIs** – including `speechSynthesis`, `canvas`, `setInterval`, and local storage  
- **TensorFlow.js** – for browser-based machine learning in selected projects  

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project resides in its own folder with the typical structure:

```graphql
html-css-js-projects/
